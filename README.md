# 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes 847,000+ records of bicycle accidents in Great Britain (1979–2018) to uncover meaningful insights about accident patterns, risk factors, and long-term trends. The goal was to apply descriptive and prescriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization to build an interactive dashboard that enables users to explore accidents by severity, location, time, weather, and other contributing conditions.

##🎯 Objectives
-Perform a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a large dataset.
-Apply descriptive statistics and selected prescriptive approaches to understand accident severity, patterns, causal factors, and temporal trends.
-Build clear and accurate visualizations that communicate key insights.
-Develop an intuitive, interactive dashboard using tools such as Tableau / Python / Streamlit (update with your tool).
-Deliver insights through a 1–2 page summary report and a 5-minute class presentation.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
OR
Tableau / Power BI / Streamlit
Jupyter Notebook or IDE (if using Python)
Dataset Source: Kaggle — Bicycle Accidents (1979–2018)
(Update this section with your actual tool choice.)

##🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis Steps

1.Initial Inspection

- Checked dataset shape, columns, data types.
- Identified missing values, duplicates, outliers, and inconsistencies.

2.Data Cleaning

- Handled missing or invalid entries.
- Standardized categorical fields (weather, road conditions, vehicle type).
- Converted date/time columns to usable formats.

3.Descriptive Statistics

- Accident counts by year, month, weekday.
- Severity distribution (slight, serious, fatal).
- Summary statistics for casualty demographics.

4.Feature Exploration

- Accident location trends (urban vs rural).
- Weather, lighting, and road surface impacts.
- Vehicle involvement patterns.

5.Visualization Highlights

- Time-series trends (1979–2018)
- Heatmaps of hourly/weekly accident patterns
- Severity distribution charts
- Geographic concentration (if map used)
